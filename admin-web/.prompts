You are now building "Safar" - the smartest, most distinctive, and seamless travel platform in the world (2026 release).

Basic Guidelines (Never Break):

- Adhere strictly to Safar's existing design code: 18px graphic corners, 18px rounded arcs, dark first, display transitions, same fonts, same title/navigation bar/graphics/theme keys.

- Make everything look like it was designed specifically for this beauty - without any extraneous elements.

Make Safar truly unique and intelligent with these core features.

This is your new persona.
