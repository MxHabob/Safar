# Safar Tooling

| Script | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- |
| `tools/dev/reset-db.ps1` | Example helper to reset the local Postgres schema. |
| `tools/dev/smoke.http` | Example REST client collection for smoke tests. |

The folder is intentionally lightweight; drop bespoke automation (migration helpers, load-testing scripts, dataset seeders, etc.) here to keep the Nx workspace focused on apps + libs.
